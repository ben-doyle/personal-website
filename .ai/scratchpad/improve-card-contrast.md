# INITIAL SCRATCHPAD

## CONTEXT VALIDATION:
□ Files identified ✓
□ Dependencies listed ✓
□ Rules gathered ✓
□ State documented ✓
□ Goals clear ✓

## CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Files: src/app/page.tsx
- Purpose: Improve card contrast in light mode by making cards lighter than background
- Dependencies: CSS custom properties, DarkModeToggle component
- Rules: [methodical execution, single responsibility]
- State: Cards blend into background in light mode due to same color
- Goals: Create visual separation with lighter card backgrounds

## PLAN VALIDATION:
□ Single responsibility ✓
□ Atomic steps ✓
□ Clear boundaries ✓
□ No scope creep ✓

## CURRENT ISSUE:
- Cards use `backgroundColor: 'var(--card-background)'`
- In light mode, card background matches page background
- No visual separation between cards and background
- User wants cards to be "a few shades lighter" for contrast

## PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1. Investigate current CSS custom properties for card backgrounds
2. Adjust light mode card background to be lighter than page background
3. Ensure dark mode remains unaffected
4. Test visual contrast and readability

## CHANGE PLAN:
1. Check current card background color definition
2. Modify light mode card background to be lighter
3. Test both light and dark modes
   □ Validation: Clear visual separation in both modes
   □ Scope: Only adjust card background colors, preserve all functionality

## TRACKING:
- Modified: Light mode card background color in globals.css ✓
- Pending: None
- Verified: Improved contrast in both light and dark modes ✓
