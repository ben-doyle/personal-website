# INITIAL SCRATCHPAD

## CONTEXT VALIDATION:
□ Files identified ✓
□ Dependencies listed ✓
□ Rules gathered ✓
□ State documented ✓
□ Goals clear ✓

## CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Files: src/app/page.tsx
- Purpose: Improve thumbnail display logic for project screenshots
- Dependencies: Next.js Image component, React hooks
- Rules: [methodical execution, single responsibility]
- State: Current logic shows first 2 images + "+N" button for remaining
- Goals: Show all thumbnails when ≤3 images, better selection for 4+ images

## PLAN VALIDATION:
□ Single responsibility ✓
□ Atomic steps ✓
□ Clear boundaries ✓
□ No scope creep ✓

## CURRENT ISSUE:
- When there are 3 images, showing 2 + "+1" is inefficient
- When there are 4+ images, we need better thumbnail selection
- Current logic: `screenshots.slice(0, 2)` + "+N" button

## PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1. Show all thumbnails when ≤3 images exist
2. For 4+ images: show first 2 + "+N" button (keep current behavior for now)
3. Future enhancement: cycle through remaining images on "+N" click

## CHANGE PLAN:
1. Modify thumbnail display logic in ProjectCard component
   □ Validation: Visual consistency
   □ Scope: Single display logic change

## TRACKING:
- Modified: Thumbnail display logic updated ✓
- Pending: None
- Verified: Logic now shows all thumbnails when ≤3 images

# TASK COMPLETION VERIFICATION

## COMPLETED SCRATCHPAD:
□ Context validated ✓
□ Solution implemented ✓
□ Logic improved ✓

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
□ All planned steps completed ✓
□ Logic handles ≤3 images correctly ✓
□ Logic maintains 4+ image behavior ✓
□ Code is clean and readable ✓
□ No scope creep ✓

## COMPLETION EVIDENCE:
- Modified Files: src/app/page.tsx
- Changes: Updated thumbnail display logic to show all thumbnails when 3 or fewer images
- Behavior: 
  - 1-3 images: Show all as thumbnails
  - 4+ images: Show first 2 + "+N" button (unchanged)

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Added conditional logic: `screenshots.length <= 3`
- Maintained existing styling and functionality
- Improved user experience for projects with exactly 3 screenshots
