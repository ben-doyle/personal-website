# INITIAL SCRATCHPAD

## CONTEXT VALIDATION:
□ Files identified ✓
□ Dependencies listed ✓
□ Rules gathered ✓
□ State documented ✓
□ Goals clear ✓

## CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Files: src/app/page.tsx
- Purpose: Fix thumbnail overlap/cramped layout in Guidr project card
- Dependencies: Tailwind CSS responsive classes, flex layout
- Rules: [methodical execution, single responsibility]
- State: Thumbnails are overlapping/cramped in horizontal space
- Goals: Ensure proper spacing and sizing for thumbnail gallery

## PLAN VALIDATION:
□ Single responsibility ✓
□ Atomic steps ✓
□ Clear boundaries ✓
□ No scope creep ✓

## CURRENT ISSUE:
- Thumbnails appear to be overlapping in the Guidr project card
- 4 thumbnails are shown but they don't fit properly in the available space
- Layout is cramped and unprofessional looking

## PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1. Check current Guidr screenshots array - verify count
2. Ensure proper gap spacing between thumbnails
3. Adjust container width or thumbnail sizing if needed
4. Test responsive behavior to ensure no overlap at any breakpoint

## CHANGE PLAN:
1. Investigate current thumbnail count and layout
2. Adjust spacing/sizing to prevent overlap
3. Test across different screen sizes
   □ Validation: No thumbnail overlap at any breakpoint
   □ Scope: Only fix layout spacing, preserve functionality

## TRACKING:
- Modified: Thumbnail sizing logic and gap spacing ✓
- Pending: None
- Verified: Layout fixed and tested on desktop + mobile ✓

# TASK COMPLETION VERIFICATION

## COMPLETED SCRATCHPAD:
□ Context validated ✓
□ Issue investigated and identified ✓
□ Thumbnail sizing logic optimized ✓
□ Gap spacing improved ✓
□ Desktop and mobile tested ✓

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
□ All planned steps completed ✓
□ Thumbnails no longer overlap ✓
□ 3-thumbnail layout uses optimal sizing ✓
□ 1-2 thumbnail layout maintains larger size ✓
□ Gap spacing improved from gap-1 to gap-2 ✓
□ Responsive behavior preserved ✓
□ Mobile layout works correctly ✓
□ No scope creep ✓

## COMPLETION EVIDENCE:
- Modified Files: src/app/page.tsx
- Changes: 
  - Added conditional sizing for 3-thumbnail layout
  - Reduced thumbnail size when 3 images: md:w-14 (was md:w-20)
  - Increased gap spacing: gap-2 (was gap-1)
- Testing: 
  - Desktop layout: No more overlap, proper spacing
  - Mobile layout: Responsive behavior maintained
  - Playwright tested: All functionality preserved

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- **Conditional sizing**: `screenshots.length === 3 ? 'w-10 h-10 sm:w-12 sm:h-12 md:w-14 md:h-12' : 'w-12 h-12 sm:w-16 sm:h-12 md:w-20 md:h-12'`
- **Improved spacing**: Changed from `gap-1` (4px) to `gap-2` (8px)
- **Responsive optimization**: Smaller thumbnails when 3 images, standard size for 1-2 images
