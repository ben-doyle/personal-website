# TASK COMPLETION VERIFICATION
COMPLETED SCRATCHPAD:
☑️ All planned steps completed
☑️ Consistent theming applied
☑️ CSS variables used instead of hardcoded colors
☑️ Single responsibility maintained

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
☑️ All planned steps completed
☑️ Dropdown background uses CSS variables
☑️ Maintains existing border styling
☑️ No scope creep

COMPLETION EVIDENCE:
- Modified Files: src/app/page.tsx
- Change: Replaced `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` with `style={{backgroundColor: 'var(--card-background)'}}`
- Result: Dropdown now properly follows theme system

## Problem
The dropdown for extra images in project cards has a dark background in light mode because it uses hardcoded `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` classes instead of the CSS variable system.

## Solution
Replace the hardcoded Tailwind classes with inline styles using `backgroundColor: 'var(--card-background)'` to match the theming pattern used throughout the rest of the component.

## Implementation
- Target: Line ~301 in src/app/page.tsx
- Change: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` → `style={{backgroundColor: 'var(--card-background)'}}`
- Keep: Border styling as it already uses appropriate classes
