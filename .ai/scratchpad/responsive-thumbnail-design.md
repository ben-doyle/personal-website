# INITIAL SCRATCHPAD

## CONTEXT VALIDATION:
□ Files identified ✓
□ Dependencies listed ✓
□ Rules gathered ✓
□ State documented ✓
□ Goals clear ✓

## CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Files: src/app/page.tsx
- Purpose: Make thumbnails responsive (square on smaller screens) and match icon size to thumbnails
- Dependencies: Tailwind CSS responsive classes
- Rules: [methodical execution, single responsibility]
- State: Currently only icon scales, thumbnails stay rectangular, icon size doesn't match thumbnails
- Goals: Responsive square thumbnails + consistent icon/thumbnail sizing

## PLAN VALIDATION:
□ Single responsibility ✓
□ Atomic steps ✓
□ Clear boundaries ✓
□ No scope creep ✓

## CURRENT ISSUE:
- Thumbnails are fixed at w-20 h-12 (rectangular) on all screen sizes
- Icon doesn't match thumbnail dimensions
- Only icon responds to screen width changes

## PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1. Add responsive classes for thumbnails: rectangular on larger screens, square on smaller
2. Match icon size to thumbnail size at each breakpoint
3. Use Tailwind responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) for consistent sizing

## CHANGE PLAN:
1. Update thumbnail sizing classes to be responsive
2. Update icon container sizing to match thumbnails
3. Test responsive behavior at different screen widths
   □ Validation: Consistent sizing between icon and thumbnails
   □ Scope: Only modify sizing classes, preserve functionality

## TRACKING:
- Modified: All thumbnail and icon sizing made responsive ✓
- Pending: None
- Verified: Full responsive functionality tested with Playwright ✓
