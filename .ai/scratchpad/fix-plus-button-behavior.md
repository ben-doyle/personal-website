# INITIAL SCRATCHPAD

## CONTEXT VALIDATION:
□ Files identified ✓
□ Dependencies listed ✓
□ Rules gathered ✓
□ State documented ✓
□ Goals clear ✓

## CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Files: src/app/page.tsx
- Purpose: Fix +N button behavior to provide image selection instead of just opening one image
- Dependencies: React useState, existing modal system
- Rules: [methodical execution, single responsibility]
- State: +N button currently opens screenshots[2] directly without choice
- Goals: Create dropdown/gallery for remaining images when +N is clicked

## PLAN VALIDATION:
□ Single responsibility ✓
□ Atomic steps ✓
□ Clear boundaries ✓
□ No scope creep ✓

## CURRENT ISSUE:
- Playwright test confirmed: "+2" button opens only the 3rd image
- No way to choose which of the remaining 2 images to view
- Poor UX - user expects selection, not hardcoded image

## PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1. Create a thumbnail dropdown/gallery that shows when +N is clicked
2. Allow users to select which of the remaining images to view
3. Keep existing modal system for full-size viewing

## CHANGE PLAN:
1. Add state for managing expanded thumbnail view
2. Modify +N button to toggle thumbnail gallery instead of direct image open
3. Create mini-gallery component for remaining images
   □ Validation: User can see and select from remaining images
   □ Scope: Only modify thumbnail behavior, keep modal unchanged

## TRACKING:
- Modified: ProjectCard component with dropdown gallery ✓
- Pending: None
- Verified: Full functionality tested with Playwright ✓
